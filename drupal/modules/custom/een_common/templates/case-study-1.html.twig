                <p>WallMuse is widening access to exhibitions and art collections with a novel digital arts platform that broadcasts indoors or outdoors to high-resolution monitors and LED displays.</p>
                <p>EEN in London has helped the company gain access to funding, to raise private finance and <a href="#">look for business partners in Europe</a>, particularly architects and interior designers, construction and building management companies.</p>
                <p>The EEN team also introduced WallMuse to the Creative Europe Culture programme, which has co-financed a collaboration with the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium and the State Museum of Contemporary Art Greece.</p>
                <p>Efforts are currently concentrated on raising equity funding in the UK and Europe and finalising plans to offer global subscription to the service.</p>

                    <p>EEN has opened doors I couldnâ€™t have on my own.</p>
